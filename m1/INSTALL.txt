--- Installation Instructions ---
1) Create and review your products in the Threadflo admin prior to installation.
2) Review laws related to collecting taxes and shipping/handling fees. By default, imported products use a tax class of Taxable Goods and your existing tax/shipping configuration. Be sure to configure your Magento system to match these laws.
2) Ensure [MAGENTO_BASE_DIR]/cron.php is running at least every 15 minutes by running crontab -l on the command line.
3) Copy contents of app folder to [MAGENTO_BASE_DIR]/app/.
4) Copy contents of shell folder to [MAGENTO_BASE_DIR]/shell/.
5) Copy contents of skin folder to [MAGENTO_BASE_DIR]/skin/.
6) Login to the Magento admin.
7) Clear cache. Log out and log back in.
8) Enable system logs in System > Configuration > Developer > Log Settings.
9) Configure extension in System > Configuration > Threadflo > General.
10) Clear cache again.
11) For small catalogs, go to Catalog > Threadflo and press the Sync Designs button to import your Threadflo items. Then, click on the Update Products button to create your product catalog.
12) For medium to large catalogs, it is strongly advised to run the following functions via command line. Change directory to [MAGENTO_BASE_DIR]/shell/threadflo/. Run sync-designs.php, then update-products.php afterward.
